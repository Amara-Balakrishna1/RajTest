TravelBudget planner---freelancer concept
1. I want the user to be able to create trips in the dashboard where they select the number of days the trip will go fore and the total trip budget.
2. When the user creates the trip the total budget should distribute the budget equally for each day so they know how much they are able to spend each day.
3. The user must be able to store each expense in the system and That will deduct from the daily budget.
4. There should be a main dashboard that will show how much they have left to spend for the current day and how much they have left in their trip budget.
5. If the user spends over there allotted budget it should take that and minus it from the daily budget for the rest of the trip equally.
6. The system should be set up as a SAAS where there will be a trial period and then a monthly fee.
7. There should be an admin panel where i can review the users details and information about there trips to provide support.
8. The user should be able to create multiple trips and swap between them.
9. The app should be responsive as i want to look at building an android and IOS app.
10. The design should be modern but have a little bit of the vintage travel look (For example a Airmail Stripe boarder)
